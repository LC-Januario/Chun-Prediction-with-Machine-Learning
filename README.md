## Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for retaining valuable customers and improving business strategies. In this project, we used machine learning to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on various features.

## Project Steps

### Data Understanding

- **Objective:** Understand the dataset and identify key features that influence customer churn.
- **Activities:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships.
  - Visualizations to understand the distribution of features.
  - Summary statistics to get an overview of the data.

### Data Preparation

- **Objective:** Prepare the data for model training.
- **Activities:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Normalizing numerical features.
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Model Training

- **Objective:** Train a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- **Activities:**
  - Training model using the training dataset.
  - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Parameter Optimization

- **Objective:** Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
- **Activities:**
  - Using Grid Search to find the best parameters.
  - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

We achieved an accuracy of **85%** in predicting customer churn using the optimized machine learning model. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
